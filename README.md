# Thoughts - A Static Blog Website

This is a static blog website built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It's designed to be easy to use and deploy to any static hosting service.

## How to Use This Blog

### Local Development

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Visit `http://localhost:8080` to view the blog

### Adding New Posts

This blog is designed as a static site. There are a few ways to manage content:

1. **Using the Create Post Interface** (Demo only):
   - Navigate to `/create` in the UI
   - Fill out the form and submit your post
   - In a real implementation, you would need to save this data permanently

2. **Directly in Code** (Production approach):
   - Edit the `samplePosts` array in `src/components/PostGrid.tsx`
   - Add your new post object with the required fields
   - Rebuild and redeploy the site

### Recommended Production Setup

For a real production blog, consider:

1. Using a static site generator like Next.js, Gatsby, or Astro
2. Integrating with a headless CMS like:
   - Contentful
   - Sanity
   - Strapi
   - Or simply using Markdown files in your repository

3. Setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automatically build and deploy your site when content changes

### Deploying Your Blog

1. Build the project with `npm run build`

   - Netlify
